kings playoff notes stauber tv ratings etc los angeles kings notes playoffs stauber disturbed by third man theme by rick sadowski daily news barry melrose s decision to stick robb stauber in the stands rather than in the crease or even on the bench for the stanley cup playoffs does not sit well with the rookie goaltender i want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year the most fun time of the year and i m not stauber said with some emotion monday i think i have worked hard enough for that stauber said he accepts melrose s choice of kelly hrudey as the teams top goalie in their playoff series with the calgary flames hrudey made saves in sundays opening victory but stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the no man behind rick knickle stauber had a record and goals against average down the stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the no job from hrudey knickle he won of decisions but had a bloated average twice was yanked from games once for stomach cramps and hasn t played since march yet when the series resumes wednesday knickle will serve as hrudey s backup again and stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on olympic saddledome popcorn if i m supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter i dropped too what happened to no stauber wondered not that i d be happy with no but i feel i should at least be a part of this team in the playoffs perhaps stauber eventually will get his chance but melrose apparently is not convinced the year old is capable of handling playoff pressure while insisting he is the kings goalie of the future melrose said stauber flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season they were according to melrose a loss to san jose on dec an loss to the new york rangers on jan a tie with detroit on feb an loss to vancouver on thursday four times this season robb could have emerged as the elite goalie he could have taken it away from kelly hrudey and he didn t do it melrose said an elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him the mark of a great goalie is that he isn t satisfied to be a backup i m not blaming robb for the losses but if you re going to be no you ve got to be able to walk your talk you ve got to be able to play when everything is on the line robb stauber has a great deal of ability but maybe i expect more from him than he does ouch that remark stung stauber he began the season struggled when the team hit a mid season slump didn t play for a month after knickle was signed off the san diego gulls roster then came on at the end i expect more from myself than anybody including barry melrose said stauber a three year star at the university of minnesota who left school in only to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries what i ve been through the last four years two knee operations a herniated disk in my back shoulder surgery what more can i go through i obviously do expect a lot from myself otherwise i wouldn t be here anybody who would disagree with that doesn t know me i m not saying barry doesn t know me but don t say i ve been without expectations if anything i m a perfectionist stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games melrose mentioned but even though i didn t play well i get knocked down from maybe on to three it s a bit of a jump he said you re almost no or if you play a good game you re no and if you don t you re no why does jack nicklaus shoot a and then a can you explain that that s what barry wanted me to explain to him why i didn t come through when he counted on me i don t know what i do know is it s a sport i ll be there melrose s goalie of the future statement doesn t mean much to stauber before you know it i ll be and there will be no future he said game of the kings flames playoff series drew a nielsen rating on abc channel here in la the kings averaged a nielsen rating in the regular season games aired on channel around the nhl san jose fired coach george kingston who lead the team to a mark in their nd nhl season kingston was over the past years with the sharks former islander executive bill torrey was named as president of the expansion florida panthers bobby clarke was named as the clubs general manager last nights games win van van leads tor det det leads stan willis willis empire dnet hac com net contact l a kings talk with the l a kings mailing list kings cs stanford edu to subscribe or unsubscribe kings request cs stanford edu

johnson adam graves can rod brind amour shayne corson shots on goal penalties attendance referee sweden min rob hearn usa canada min bill ranford stopped shots to lead canada to a victory in a very well played game the first period started with a give away from a canadian defenseman and rundqvist came in alone on ranford but couldn t put the puck over a sliding ranford later on kevin dineen had a great opportunity but soderstrom played very well too stefan nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up jan larsson but again ranford came up big period ended scoreless but the edge to sweden in creating more opportunities second period action saw tommy soderstrom making a great save mark recchi made a backhanded cross ice pass to lindros eric one timed the puck but soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save at the minute mark canada started applying pressure on the swedes sanderson dineen brind amour worked hard and kept the puck in the swedes zone dineen gave the puck to sanderson who skated around a screened swedish defenseman came in on soderstrom and made a wrist shot that went it by soderstrom s far post canada the swedes picked up their game after that and peter forsberg had a shot that hit ranford s post the inside went parallel to the goal line and out then gartner got a penalty and the swedes a power play jan larsson took a shot from the slot ranford gave a rebound to larsson who saw juhlin by the far post passed the puck and ranford was beat third period started as the other periods swedes having most of the pressure but the canadians always dangerous once they were close to the swede goal at canada created some great chances and arto blomsten was forced to cover the puck in the swede goal crease since soderstrom lost sight of it that resulted in a penalty shot since a defenseman can t cover the puck in the goal crease geoff sanderson took the penalty shot his first ever he explained afterwards and he put it low on soderstrom s stick side close to the post excellent penalty shot to give canada a go ahead goal canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside gartner volleyed a bouncing puck past soderstrom to make it the swedes ran out of gas then and couldn t produce as good scoring chances as they had for periods the goal came with only second left rod brind amour scoring on a rebound from soderstrom where the swedish defense already had their minds in the dressing room a very good game the best in the wc so far with both goalies playing great soderstrom best player in sweden but ranford even played better than soderstrom that tells you something about ranford probably the best goalie in the world were some comments after the game canada played a very disciplined defense ranford pointed out that it is easy to play well with a good defense lindros played a lot and played well sanderson naturally game hero with two goals the forsberg naslund bergqvist line sweden s best along with larsson juhlin nilsson swedish defense played well cm kg peter popovic had the task of neutralizing cm kg eric lindros and managed this very well ranger defenseman peter andersson finally got to go to the wc and considering that he landed in germany just a few hours before the game he played very well swedish coach curt lundmark was irritated after the game partly because of the swedes inability to score and partly because of the

re flyers re this year s biggest and worst opinion in article apr cbnewsh cb att com seth cbnewsh cb att com peter r clark jr writes so in other words if roussel shuts out the sharks and soderstrom shuts out the penguins that s immaterial because it was the coaches decision come on joe think about what you re saying who they played is very significant why they played them is what s irrelevent a low gaa against good teams is better than a low gaa against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders a low gaa is better then a higher gaa a low gaa against good teams is much much better than a higher gaa against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders let s start over i m not arguing about who is the better goaltender i d take soderstrom right now what i am saying is that roussel can be a netminder the gaa difference is less than half a goal per game less than that after last night their save percentages are close and their records are similar and with that i just don t see how you can label roussel as the most disappointing player on the flyers this season you say soderstrom played against better competition that may very well be but there is no way of knowing how roussel would have performed in those games besides against the better scoring teams like pittsburgh the defense is more keyed up than they are against san jose the same for roussel in the ranger game two real scoring chances one he made a great play the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player if you were judging roussel on that game alone you have very little to go by but i m not just judging roussel on that game alone i ve seen him play for the past two seasons in philly and before that in hershey it s just my opinion but i think he s got what it takes of course i thought that about mark laforest too but i never did about wendell young so i m batting in judging hershey talent since the hextall era as for the rangers game you can say he was saved by a mistake by the offensive player if you like but rou had his leg in position to make the save if he didn t it wouldn t have mattered if the rangers player didn t get the puck up or not it would have been a goal on a breakaway that s what the goalie wants to do take away as much as possible and force the shooter to beat him but if you were to look at the tie against the habs you saw a goalie stand on his head to get that shutout that was a goalie in action roussel doesn t have a game like that in him i seem to remember roussel doing an excellent job against pittsurgh on opening night to give the flyers a tie against the two time defending champs and not to take anything away from soderstrom because he was senational in that game agains the habs but you can t tell me that a montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game and just flat out missed it mistakes both on offense and defense are part of the game or there d never be shutouts anyway i m happy the flyers have both soderstrom and roussel and i m not going to argue about it anymore besides with the current game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year i don t want to piss you off to the point that you don t sell me any tickets next season joe dakes at t microelectronics union boulevard allentown pa let s go flyers alux jmd jmd aluxpo att com

re plus minus stat brad gibson gibson nukta geop ubc ca wrote much text deleted plus minus it is the most misleading hockey stat available not necessarily the most misleading but you are right it definitely needs to be taken in the proper perspective a shining example is if you look at the penguins individual you will find very few minuses that only makes common sense since they didn t lose many games until the nhl publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice time per game and some measure of its quality i e is the player put out in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game is he matched up against the other team s top one or two lines short handed etc i would much rather see the disappear altogether instead of having its dubious merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications unfortunately you will need to keep a ridiculous number of stats to really come up with a statistic which really shows a player s value let s just enjoy the game and not overanalyze it like i m doing now excuse me tom huot huot cray com

flyers notes the flyers blew a lead over the buffalo sabres in the second period but kevin dineen s th career hat trick powered them to their th consecutive win over the sabres who have now lost in a row alexander mogilny led the comeback scoring his th and th goals of the season which tied the game at in the nd period and in the rd tommy soderstrom stopped of shots on goal to improve his own record to as he was tested by mogilny and lafontaine all night roster move andre faust was once again recalled from hershey shawn cronin was a healthy scratch lines eklund lindros recchi beranek brind amour dineen lomakin butsayev conroy faust acton brown galley bowen yushkevich hawgood carkner mcgill tommy soderstrom game summary say if anybody from buffalo is reading this where did you people get that woman who sang the anthems we had to turn down the volume the flyers defense started out the game showing everybody why the flyers have been shutting teams out lately by holding the sabres to only shots in the first period they then showed everybody why they will be playing golf sunday when they gave up shots in the last two periods maybe tommy told them that he was getting bored back there mark recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it after buffalo won the faceoff and dumped tommy wrapped the puck around the boards to eric way up on his left eric dropped it to galley and he sent it ahead to recchi steaming out of the zone mark skated into the center circle passed the puck to himself through the legs of richard smehlik skated around him and in on fuhr smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his stick recchi drifted right drifted back left and slid the puck back to the right past fuhr for a flyers lead at it was so beautiful eric and garry should turn down their assists the flyers kept the pressure on fuhr for a while after that but he was strong and kept the flyers from doing further damage the game then became a defensive struggle for a while the sabres got the first chance on the power play when terry carkner took a boarding minor at for crunching dale hawerchuk into the boards in the flyers zone lafontaine got the only scoring chance and not a terribly good one as the flyers smothered the sabres power play mogilny got a post after it was over the th consecutive penalty kill for the flyers keith carney took a holding penalty at for taking down mark recchi to give the flyers a power play the best penalty killing team in the league didn t allow the flyers a shot on goal although the flyers did create a good scoring chance for lindros who partially fanned on his shot towards the end of the period the play started going end to end but everybody kept missing the net greg hawgood took an interference penalty at to give the sabres another power play but they couldn t get anything going and the fans expressed their displeasure particularly when they iced the puck shots were buffalo after the flyers had led at one point mike emrick interviewed flyers president jay snider between periods jay was disappointed to not make the playoffs but not discouraged this was considered a rebuilding year after the trade and he seemed very happy with the way the season went when asked if he agonized over the trade he said that it was russ farwell s trade and not his that it only was an issue for him and ed snider as far as the money but yes there was some agonizing and they d do it all over again when asked how the coaching situation would be handled for next year he said that it s russ call and russ will evaluate things at the end of the season he feels that they re years away from a shot at the cup he expects to get into the playoffs next year have a shot at a division title the following year and a shot at the finals the year after that this based on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer he s very happy with the re alignment he called it outstanding happy with the current expansion feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux of europeans but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable seemed to like the idea of playing in the olympics booo but said that there was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in four years if there was a consensus the sabres gave the flyers their second power play of the game when brad may took a tripping penalty at of the second the flyers had a little trouble getting started but eventually did hawgood took a pass as he was moving throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to eklund just outside the sabres blue line along the right boards eklund carried into the zone nad passed across to dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the top of the left circle he half fanned on it and sent the puck trickling through the slot fuhr didn t know where it was though and hawgood won the race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at then mogilny on a breakaway he slipped through two flyers at the blue line and went in on soderstrom he went with the backhander but soderstrom was all over it the flyers then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them viacheslav butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor then according to gary dornhoefer took a dive to get the other there was no video at the sabres coudln t get started ryan mcgill poked at the puck just after a sabre carried into the flyers zone and after a bunch of people poked at it dineen emerged with it and headed the other way it started out a on but brind amour hustled ahead to make it a on and back off the defenseman dineen let it rip from the top of the right circle to make it flyers at that was all for fuhr john muckler sent in dominik hasek to take over but the sabres still had lots of power play time again they took some time to just get into the flyers zone and when they finally did the flyers were all over them boos began to ring through the building but they finally got through soderstrom on an ugly goal smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that missed and kicked out to hawerchuk in the slot hawerchuk tried a backhander as he skated towards the goal line to the right as galley dove down to block it mistake he should have let soderstrom handle the backhander and worried about a the rebound or b barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right next to the net well the rebound dropped right next to soderstrom and mistake galley just laid there and watched barnaby get three hacks at the puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie he didn t even swing his stick out to try and knock the puck away with the goal at two streaks end for the flyers of shutout hockey and straight penalty kills lindros put them right back on the power play at with a high sticking minor i think it was barnaby again this time the sabres were able to get set up quickly but couldn t get too much quality on goal the sabres continued to keep the puck in the flyers end for a while after the power play ended things evetually settled down but then the other very bad penalty mcgill allowed barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a faceoff the gloves were dropped and mcgill started pounding the crap out of him but during the fight he gave barnaby a head butt with his helmet and that meant a match penalty for slashing fighting and for the major minutes of power play time for the sabres at barnaby only got the flyers were keeping them at bay for a while but there was only so long they could do that after a couple of good sabre chances audette handed to ledyard at the point and ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by soderstrom lafontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of the net and knocked it over to randy wood at the right soderstrom had moved over to play lafontaine and since yushkevich and carkner were waving at the puck instead of picking up men wood just slid it into the empty net at to close the flyers lead to lafontaine was actually trying to put it on net but half fanned on it and got a break the flyers then got some shorthanded pressure in the sabres zone but hasek was strong finally it was keith carney passing ahead to hawerchuk into the neutral zone and hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to mogilny at the flyers blue line another mini breakaway for mogilny he elected to shoot from the left circle and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at for his th of the season ironically the youth hockey tip between the st and second period was tommy soderstrom talking about cutting off angles that was all in the nd shots were sabres into the rd period and pelle eklund blew a golden opportunity to get the flyers the lead back a on acton with the puck he dropped to eklund in the slot and eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until he had almost no angle at all to shoot from when he finally did shoot he hit the far post that was still during the carryover power play time than an incredible almost goal randy wood skated around recchi and hawgood untouched into soderstrom soderstrom goes down wood pokes the puck under soderstrom and a black object hits the back of the net red light comes on horn sounds crowd cheers but up to the video replay booth for some strange reason and in the meantime emrick and dornhoefer try to figure out what they could be reviewing well it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade that went into the net not the puck emrick mentions that one of the criteria for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net dave hannan then took out recchi and got a holding minor at the flyers could not get anything going at all they finally got set up way through but were kept on the perimeter as time ran out beranek stripped the puck from a sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across to eklund at the top of the left circle eklund saw dineen heading at the net just inside the right circle and passed through to him dineen fumbled the pass but twice directed it at hasek and eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing puck over the goalie for his th at flyers but the sabres came right back lafontaine picked up the puck in his offensive left corner and slid it to bob erry behind the flyers net erry started to skate out but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net mogilny flew in skated around and stuffed it through soderstrom s hole for his th at to tie the game at then hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at the flyers set up in the sabres zone and stayed there off a faceoff high in the sabres zone in the middle while brind amour wrestled for the puck dineen snuck through the line and wristed a perfect shot low to hasek s glove side at play started to go back and forth until hawgood took a roughing penalty at the flyers dumped the puck into the sabres zone brind amour and ledyard went after it and rod got the puck he backed away from the right boards skated to the right faceoff dot and passed between his legs to dineen crashing through the slot all by himself dineen waited patiently and lifted it over the blocker of hasek for a flyers lead at rd hat trick of the season for dineen th of his career nd shorthanded goal of the game for him th of the season then carney took a tripping penalty at to kill the rest of the sabres power play not much action on the on and the sabres got most of the chances on the flyers resulting power play play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to make some big saves the sabres weren t able to pull hasek as time was running out as the flyers wouldn t allow any consistant possession for the sabres finally as time was running out ken sutton misplayed the puck in his own left corner and brind amour stripped it away from him he pulled away and found dineen on the other side of the left circle and dineen found acton at the right of hasek he slid the puck between two sabres defenders and acton chipped it back to the far side of hasek for his th of the season at on his th birthday that was all the scoring shots were buffalo and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the game so another strong game from tommy soderstrom who hadn t been tested much in his last couple of starts kevin dineen has a career high point night unless he had a better night earlier in the season but i don t think so the flyers longest winning streak in years goals for only against with three shutouts eric lindros is th in league with even strength goals despite missing games with injury points out of th clinched th place since the rangers lose the tie breaker a couple misc notes forget the mike keenan rumors there will be a press conference tommorrow to announce that he will be head coach of the new york rangers next year in the last notes i mentioned that garry galley won the barry ashbee award but i failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman the times of trenton has reported that a preeminent specialist from oklahoma has looked over tommy soderstrom s medical record and determined that no further tests are necessary in the near future same paper had a blurb about bill
