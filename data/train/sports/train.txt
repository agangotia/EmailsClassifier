re young catchers in article blue cis pitt edu genetic pitt edu david m tate writes mss netcom com mark singer said i meant that one should not let the exception make the rule it s not an exception good players come up young most players who come up young will be good this has always been the rule are most players who come up young always good when they re young or later worse it s not a shift this is the way it has always been several detailed studies of this have been done and they ve all shown that players aren t coming up any younger or older than in the past and they aren t playing any more or less in the minors than they used to the only thing that shifts is our memories of the good old days damn i was afraid you would say that but all after the fact which makes it not applicable to the current discussion which is about how you decide whether to play the rookie who hasn t established himself in the majors over the mediocre veteran the padres played santiago that year because they clearly had nobody else worth playing well perhaps if the braves had no one else worth playing this year it would be lopez in there but they do have others worth playing at least in their opinion and i happen to agree both of these young men were highly touted defensive catchers expected to be among the best ever in baseball not by rec sport baseball consensus that may sound like an incredibly arrogant comment but i ve found that the sdcn consensus when one exists is right far more often than the media consensus or the opinions of baseball people affiliated with mlb i can believe that i m a newbie here so i ll take your word but alomar is a fine defensive catcher which was my statement above that is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age as long as they feel he can also hit a bit lopez does not have such a consensus about his defensive prowess and imho that is enough to give him that dreaded seasoning i don t know who knows i suppose the same people or similar who know he will be better than some other catcher these are of course just differing opinions i read that his arm is not that strong i suppose somewhere there is some measurement of sb ratios and that he is still learning to call a game that latter skill may be difficult to project on someone without an intimate knowledge of his performance but it is a tangible skill i disagree in that i don t think it is a tangible skill any more than leadership is i don t deny that it is a real skill and that some catchers may be much better than others at it but i really don t see any way that we could ever know who they are nichols s law of catcher defense is eerily accurate far too often for me to take defensive assessments of catchers very seriously sorry new don t know nichols law don t believe in catchers era but i am interested in pitchers eras with different catchers any info on that absolutely the evidence is piling up year after year the only other alternative is that the braves really don t know that their young players are on average better than their current starters i m not ruling out that kind of gross incompetence but i think the salary schedule explanation is more charitable in other words we know more than they do so the only logic behind a different decision than we would make must be financial i presume we feel this way about other franchises than atlanta no consider we know that the braves are about the strongest team in baseball right now even with olson and lemke and nixon and bream in the lineup they have as good a chance of repeating as champs this year as any team ever has it actually makes some sense to say rather than making our team marginally better this year by bringing up the young studs and dumping the elderly let s go ahead and compete this year with what we have and then bring up the studs only as we have to so that we ll still have them under reserve three years from now and beyond when the current team will be collecting pensions is it fair to the young players no does it make organizational sense i think it does well if it does make organizational sense one can hardly fault them for their decisions i mean please don t tell me how to run my business especially when i m being successful c i could make it or wins if you let me bring up lopez s listen bobby i d like to but the way i see it if he hits the big club this year we ll be paying mega arbitration bucks down the road in a couple of years and there s no way i want to do that and continues with we can win without him and then keep winning next year with him how s that i m sure you could be right you could also be smoking some illegal substance hey that s a joke don t get offended please hey i d love to be wrong about this if you think it s unlikely i d love to know why don t cite anybody s innate ethical rectitude though unless you know them personally well i can t cite anyone s ethical rectitude because i don t know what it means but again if it makes organizational sense then so be it baseball is a business and if there is a solid business reason for keeping lopez on the farm then that s what the braves should do i happen to believe that it s a baseball decision while you from your armchair may disagee i don t i think there is a lot of evidence to suggest the decision they made i predicted it among large guffaws from several at the start of spring training i think it is a very normal decision to have made it is certainly more reversible than to have started lopez in the bigs and have released one of their catchers sure it may be conservative it may also be logical i don t know what ethics have to do with it seems like pretty good common sense to me the beastmaster mark singer mss netcom com

re my belated predictions nl mss netcom com mark singer writes in article apr pilot njin net gajarsky pilot njin net bob gajarsky hobokenite writes javier lopez is a better catcher than greg olson but has there ever in the history of baseball been a year old or younger rookie catcher who compared favorably among all league catchers in terms of defense and brought a bat wasn t it sandy alomar who was supposed to be that good in his rookie year not wasn t it benito santiago who was supposed to be that good in his rookie year not hrm sandy alomar year old rookie games threw out a few baserunners benito santiago year old rookie games he threw out a few baserunners too ivan rodriguez year old rookies games didn t exactly suck behind the plate i can continue this thread with the others mentioned but you get the point you and others seem to be so quick to dismiss the seasoned veterans in favor of the hot young rookies perhaps just perhaps the management team of the pennant winning braves knows something more than you do and perhaps what they know is that very very few and year old rookies come up to the majors and make an impact true which only makes it more important to realize when you have one of the few lopez season last year adjusted to major league equivalencies was hrs how bad does he have to be behind the plate for that to not be better than olson s mike jones aix high end development mjones donald aix kingston ibm com i would not admire hitting against ryne duren because if he ever hit you in the head you might be in the past tense casey stengel

jim lefebvre is an idiot i just wanted to let everyone know that i have lost what little respect i have for jim lefebvre after seeing today s cubs game first of all how could he start maldonado over may after the way may played at the end of last year and the way he tore up the cactus league how could you let him sit the bench not to mention that a right hander maddux started i really blew my top when lefebvre pinch hit for rick wilkins with tommy shields how can you do that just because of the lefty righty thing too much is made of that wilkins is twice the hitter that shields is then the next batter was jose vizcaino one of the weakest hitters i have ever seen and who had looked terrible at bat all day and lefebre let him hit while may still sat the bench i think even arnie harris was stunned by this because he showed may sitting in the dugout while vizcaino was batting face it lefebvre has got to be the worst manager in baseball a dishard cub fan
re best second baseman thf ellis uchicago edu ted frank writes in article mar sarah albany edu js albnyvms bitnet writes personally i think that alomar is all hype he is producing incredibly now but in the long run he will never put up the numbers that sandberg has for this moment alomar may be the best but overall sandberg wins out by a long shot when sandberg was alomar s age he was putting up seasons with no power alomar s oba is points higher than sandberg s career high alomar s career high in doubles and triples is higher than sandberg s sandberg is still better than alomar but only because alomar hasn t reached his full potential yet alomar s got a year headstart on sandberg he has hits sandberg didn t have hits until he was and is likely to put up better career numbers than sandberg in everything except home runs he ll pass sandberg in stolen bases sometime in sandberg is not particulary known for his stolen bases what competition did alomar have sandberg came in a year after ripken and the same year as boggs gwynn and the other magicians so less attention was given to sandberg alomar is the only one in his class to be worth a mediocre besides the numbers don t count national league pitchers are much better pitchers larry on someone elses account mark horan horan cse unl edu ianr unlvm

re young catchers mss netcom com mark singer said we know that very very few players at this age make much of an impact in the bigs especially when they haven t even played aaa ball yes but this is irrelevant you re talking about averages when we have lots of information about this player in particular to base our decisions on i might as well say we know that very very few people are more than feet tall so chances are that manute bol is really only foot no maybe i need to improve my writing skills lopez who is very ordinary defensively is not likely to hit so well at age having not played at aaa level that it is probably not a good idea to rush him into the braves lineup in why isn t lopez likely to hit that well he hit that well last year after adjusting his stats for park and league and such he hit better on an absolute scale than olson or berryhill did by a lot as for rushing if there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment and i don t believe there is then wouldn t you rather waste lopez s year old good season than his year old very good season or his year old excellent season the sooner you get him acclimated the more of his prime you get to use lopez was hitting over ab when he was cut from spring training what does he have to do to earn a chance maybe not a full time job but at least a couple starts and a few ab for him to prove his worth gee i don t know abs sounds pretty good to me about as good as your reasoning that the kid should play a back up role rather than start every day at aaa talk about me as a gm the point was not that ab is a significant sample but rather that he hadn t done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real or to send him down until he gets warmed up ok most players are not ready for the bigs at age most players are never ready for the bigs what does this have to do with javy lopez most players benefit rather than being stagnant or hurt by playing at aaa see above most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their clubs in the bigs those are the arguments against lopez for the braves for this year but i could apply the same reasoning to frank thomas or barry bonds most players aren t that good so they probably won t be that good this year either now the braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid abilities to call games to work with the pitchers to throw out runners and demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble not superstars mind you but solid experienced veterans not superstars not stars not even good players maybe average if we re being charitable the braves have a very solid lineup with two big bats in the outfield an excellent platoon at first a solid mvp candidate at third and one of the better hitting shortstops ummm justice is a very fine hitter pendleton might have another big year in his bat but he might also spend the season in hamstring hell gant is a big question mark the bream hunter platoon is decent not excellent and has rotten obp or slg depending on who s in blauser is a very valuable bat for a shortstop the center field platoon will probably hit however good lopez bat might be given the above it won t be so much better than what they have to offset the differential in experience and defensive ability wanna bet the difference between lopez s bat and olson berryhill could be or runs over the course of the season given a choice between a player with experience and a player who can play i ll take the latter every time the kid will improve playing at aaa just like keith mitchell did i am just so surprised i have to spell all of this out my goodness do you believe the other poster who thinks lopez is being held down because of his future earning potential that was me and you so far your only counter proposal is that they really don t understand how good lopez is or overvalue experience or some combination of the two i think my interpretation was more flattering to the organization are they idiots who have built this ballclub well argued but inflammatory reply deleted david m tate i do not know what it is about you that closes posing as and opens only something in me understands e e can the pocket of your glove is deeper than pete rose s dy cummings nobody not even tim raines has such soft hands
re young catchers mss netcom com mark singer said in article blue cis pitt edu genetic pitt edu david m tate writes well perhaps if the braves had no one else worth playing this year it would be lopez in there but they do have others worth playing at least in their opinion catcher is their weakest position with the possible exception of second base they have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem spot with a well above average offensive player and acclimate a highly promising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team and they want to play olson and berryhill instead i disagree in that i don t think it is a tangible skill any more than leadership is i don t deny that it is a real skill and that some catchers may be much better than others at it but i really don t see any way that we could ever know who they are nichols s law of catcher defense is eerily accurate far too often for me to take defensive assessments of catchers very seriously sorry new don t know nichols law a catcher s defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his recent offensive level of performance thus mickey tettleton goes in the media from being a no hit defensive whiz to a slugging thumb finger in two short years the rule doesn t apply to perceived superstars who get the gold glove offensive transfer effect instead greg olson is probably considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he can t hit don t believe in catchers era but i am interested in pitchers eras with different catchers aren t they the same thing in other words we know more than they do so the only logic behind a different decision than we would make must be financial either that or just stupidity i presume we feel this way about other franchises than atlanta no of course is it fair to the young players no does it make organizational sense i think it does well if it does make organizational sense one can hardly fault them for their decisions i mean please don t tell me how to run my business especially when i m being successful one could make the same sort of argument in other cases pete rose in pursuing ty cobb s record was a huge gate attraction and national media magnet the reds made a lot of money off that they also wasted the prime of eric davis that may be good business but that doesn t mean i don t loathe them for it david m tate i do not know what it is about you that closes posing as and opens only something in me understands e e can the pocket of your glove is deeper than pete rose s dy cummings nobody not even tim raines has such soft hands

re young catchers since i was the one responsible for these divergent threads of approx posts going back to the braves could be better off if an injury happens i may as well inject a little more fuel to the flame back at the beginning of spring training i though lopez would make the squad easily olson was still recovering from his late season injury knee i believe and there were questions as to whether he would be able to play before june and then berryhill was dinged up i was looking forward to this because i believe that lopez can hit and field the position before last season he was the braves defensive catcher prospect while brian deak was the braves offensive catcher prospect besides olson and berryhill couldn t hit their way out of a wet cardboard box and don t walk enough to be useful but olson recovered quickly berryhill recovered and the braves went with the two vets i still say that if one of those two had been down at the start of the season he wouldn t have gotten his job back there is a certain logic to keeping olson and berryhill around after all ml catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and tear there are teams out there without one average ml catcher california and seattle come to mind certainly trying to move olson or berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work plus you d have to eat that salary which isn t huge but isn t tiddleywinks either i think olson s at about berryhill at but that s only what i recall yes i think arbitration eligibility may have a role to play in this also what is it that of the year players aren t eligible for arbitration only the that were on the roster the longest are eligible of course the system may change but the extent of that change is not yet known from a business standpoint it may make sense to keep lopez down until june the first time olson berryhill go on the dl i am still disappointed that lopez isn t on the team i still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the braves and the truth is that i d rather see our best team on the field which imo includes lopez of course today we play the cubs hopefully we won t need him as for the schuerholz cox conversation i imagine it went like this remember they ve both been gm s the following is not meant to be read by the humor impaired cox ok we ve sent jones down his fielding could be a little smoother besides blauser can hit ok and his fielding is better than it used to be schuerholz well we ll have to send nieves down too deion just won t sign that baseball only contract we can t count on him in october so we have to keep nixon around for the defense besides gorman s not ready to give up on billy hatcher yet once hatcher s gone and deion signs we can move nixon for frankie rodriguez that ought to give us some pitching depth in cox yep that ll be nice too bad deion won t sign ok i ll look for nieves when justice starts having berry berry er back problems again now what about klesko schuerholz well we ve still got to fork out another mil for bream if we keep klesko we either lose the money or cabrera i keep dangling sid in front of dal maxwell but somehow he doesn t seem to be the same gm first jeffries for jose and now whiten for clark if he gets rid of brian jordan then i d have to believe that he and whitey herzog switched bodies at the winter meetings cox ok keep trying on bream and i ll wait til the trading deadline for my hunter klesko platoon maybe i can get a few extra at bats for cabrera while we wait try california if snow starts slowly maybe whiteydal will bite on sid and if that doesn t work then perhaps sid s knees could be persuaded to act up there s always the day dl mwa ha ha ha ha schuerholz what about caraballo cox well he s not that much better than lemke maybe if he starts in richmond he ll start walking more besides if he s going to be arbitration eligible better to stretch him out so that we actually get some value from him before he makes the big bucks schuerholz now let s see that leaves lopez cox nooooo i gotta keep lopez sure i didn t think olson would recover this quickly maybe i can talk caminiti into running into him again schuerholz nope lopez has gotta go you know that he ll get million in arbitration may as well put it off that one extra year besides until olson s shown his stuff a little bit i can t trade him besides berryhill s a left handed hitter you know how rare that is cox don t you mean a left handed whiffer pretty common if you ask me i mean he made pat borders look good in the world series pat borders schuerholz hey you re the one who wouldn t write lopez into the lineup cox well you re the one who went out and got me jeff reardon besides i thought lopez wouldn t be used to our pitching staff s stuff he got some time with them this spring looked pretty good come on surely we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate schuerholz yeah but which stiff whichever one we keep will be hurt by may cox ok ok you made your point keep them both surely one of them will be on the dl by june at the latest then i can call up lopez and then we can win games the pennant the world series i ll be up there with john mcgraw casey stengel earl weaver oh they laughed at me in toronto but have you ever had to deal with george bell i ll finally get my just reward mwa ha ha ha schuerholz easy bobby have you been taking
